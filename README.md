# EV-Grid-Integration-Study

This provides a statistical analysis of the charging events from the work produced by Muratori in his PhD. Thesis. Furthermore, it builds a probabalistic model for EV Charging in a Distribution System.

The model is used to aggregate EV Charging Profiles onto residential base loads and then merge with the rest of the distribution system's load. This modified collection of base loads are formatted to be used with EMTP-RV for transient and steady state studies of EV Charging in the San Juan Distribution System.
